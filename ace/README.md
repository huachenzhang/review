# Algorithms Correctness and Efficiency 

What are algorithms ?

	> a step-by-step procedure for solving  a problem in a finite amount of time.



What are data-structure ?

> Ways in which to store data in a well-defined and structured fashion so as to allow algorithms to:
>
> 	1. make better use of it
> 	2. maintain it more easily



How to study the running-time of an alogorithm ?

Limitation of experiments :

1. must implement algorithm first
2. can not include every input
3. must use the same hareware and software while comparing two algorithm

Limitation of Theory :

1. must set up theory first
2. may ignore some corner case

**So need to combine the experiment and theory.**
